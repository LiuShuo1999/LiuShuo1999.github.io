I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, **Shandong University (SDU)**, working with the [Blockchain and Distributed Security Lab](https://bc.sdu.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiuzhen Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O1yGhH0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Minghui Xu](http://minghuixu.com/).

My research focuses on **Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) Consensus** and **Wireless Blockchain Systems**.
